# MONEI PHP SDK

The MONEI API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

This library is intended to help you develop an integration around our API, by using the MONEI PHP Client and it's methods.

require_once(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');

// Instantiate the client using the API key
$monei = new Monei\MoneiClient('YOUR_API_KEY');

try {
    $result = $monei->payments->create([
        'amount' => 1250, // 12.50â‚¬
        'orderId' => '100100000001',
